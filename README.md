This is my **2nd task** of **Prodigy summer internship** in which we  do image encryption tool using pixel manipulation
using numpy and pillow manipulation

**Key Features**: Image Manipulation in Python.
Loading: Open and read various image formats such as JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and TIFF.
Saving: Save images in different formats and control quality/compression.

**Libraries**: Image Manipulation in Python.

**Pillow** (PIL): Fork of the original Python Imaging Library, provides basic image processing capabilities.

**OpenCV**: A library for advanced computer vision and image processing tasks.

**scikit**-image: Part of the scikit-learn ecosystem, it provides tools for image processing and computer vision.

**NumPy**: Often used alongside other libraries for manipulating image data as arrays.

**imageio**: Provides simple and easy-to-use functions for reading and writing image data.
